# Mojolicious::Plugin::S3Signature

Very early development code (although I use currently for my projects). A lot to be done. I discontinued any work on Mojo::S3Object as it did too much. This module is just for signing a AWS S3 request and leaves the blocking or non-blocking code for Mojolicious to perform.
